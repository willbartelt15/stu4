    "# Lesson: Database Setup and Migration with Flask\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objective\n",
    "The primary goal of this lesson is to guide you through the process of creating and migrating a database in a Flask application. Running the provided script will ensure the database is created, primed, and contains some initial data. It's crucial to run this script whenever there are changes to the database schema.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Script Setup\n",
    "To begin, open the terminal in the root directory of your project and run the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "./migrate.sh\n"

    "- **Flexible Syntax:** Offers a flexible syntax for embedding Python-like expressions, fostering dynamic content generation.\n",
    "- **Built-in Filters:** Comes with built-in filters for easy data manipulation and formatting directly within templates.\n",
    "- **Control Structures:** Supports control structures like loops and conditionals.\n",
