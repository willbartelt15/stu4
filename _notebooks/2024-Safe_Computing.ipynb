    "A good password is somewhat random that wouldn't make any sense to a starnger. Something like KHksh59sdhHG. \n",
    "This would be goof beacuse it dosen't follow a pattern and wouldn't be able to be guessed. Facial recognition is another way to authentify. \n",

    "Symmetric encryption is when the same key is used to encrypt and dcerypt. \n",
    "Asymmetrric is better and is when a person uses somewhat of a publivc and private key. Two people would need to have to use a certain key.\n",
