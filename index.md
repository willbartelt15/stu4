## About Me

Some of my favorite things to do in my free time is playing volleyball with my friends. I play on Varsity at Del Norte as well as at Coast Volleyball, my club team.
I also like to hang out with my friends in my spare time and play games or go to the beach.

I am part of a family of five and am the youngest of my 2 siblings. I have an older brother and sister who are both in college. I also have a dog named Lily who is 10 years old.
