Throught the trimester I've learnt alot about codeing. This was my first experience codeing and using pythn and html and I enjoyed it alot. I'm excited for the future trimesters and I am excited for what we learn. I've learnt alot about Iteration, variables, algorithms, developing algorithms, list and searches, libraries, developing procedures, lists, and searches from the team teaches. I've also been able to add and create games into my own blog like pacman and donkeykong. The most important thing I've done so far this tri was the passion project. We created a calorie calulator that takes inputs and a user and gives you a recommened meal plan based on your statistics. It also sends your data and varibiales over to the backend to store it in a database. Overall I was happy about this trimester and enjoyed my group. I think that this class taught me the most because I started from no knowledge about codeing and learnt so much. Thx Mr. Lopez!!!
