- Worked on frontend code and started on our backend code
- Worked on our team teach assignment and prepared fro next week
- Completed Hw for team teach assignmnet and submitted it

## Problems I faced
- I fixed the commit problem by checking the code with you and now we can commit and pull from each other
- I also ran into a problem with the backend code and I couldn't figure out to store data in the backend
