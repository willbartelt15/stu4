## Individual review

Overview
- We made a turned based fantasy game that is player vs AI. You have the option to either attack or move around the map. Each move the enemy AI has the same option of either moving or attacking. The enemy is invisible so you don't know where he is. When he moves within one space of you you are notified and prompted to attack. before you start the game you can select from a variety of classes like mage, night, etc. which give you different strengths on the field. Once you attack and hit the enemy you win.

My feature
- For my feature I worked on the code for our AI and as well as the screens for our main game. I worked on creating the Images and the text boxes where you input your attack or movement location. Within Javascript I worked on define functions for our AI. I created functions that allowed our AI to move or attack and give it an option/probability of either moving or attacking. It generates a number between 1-9 and then chooses that location to either move or attack.

      <td> Our project lets the user battle an AI. You are given the option to move or attack and when the enemy is in range you will be notified. Your enemy is has the same options and its your job to attack and take down the enemy. The AI has a generator that picks a location on the board to wither attack or move to. this moves the enemy around the board and gives him a probability of attacking you. When you, the user, moves around the board your inputs are saved and it determines where you will move.</td>
