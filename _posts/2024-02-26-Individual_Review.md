## Individual review

Overview
- We made a turned based fantasy game that is player vs AI. You have the option to either attack or move around the map. Each move the enemy AI has the same option of either moving or attacking. The enemy is invisible so you don't know where he is. When he moves within one space of you you are notified and prompted to attack. before you start the game you can select from a variety of classes like mage, night, etc. which give you different strengths on the field. Once you attack and hit the enemy you win.
