- Finsihed our project and corrected errors that were suggested from the teacher
- Went to Night at the museum and finished passion project
- Worked on individual assignment
- Worked on mc for the final

## Problems faced
- We needed to add more to our backend code for the passion project. You said that we needed to incorperate our backend more to be able to qualify.
- Lastly the mc was hard and I needed to review information from the class to understand what we learned.
