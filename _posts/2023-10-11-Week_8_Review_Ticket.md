- Created frontend and backend
- Completed hw from team teach
- Started on frontend code

## Problems I faced
- Struggled with creating a new theme in the shared repository
- I also couldn't commit or pull. Our team couldn't pull or commit any of our work. This was on friday so we couldn't fix it by the end of the week.
