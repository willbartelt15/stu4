## MC Review

- Question 5
False, True, True, True
With these inputs, the OR gate will produce an output of true and the first AND gate will produce an output of false. Since only one input to the second AND gate will be true, the circuit will have an output of false.

- Question 11
Ivory
The binary RGB triplet for light yellow is (11111111, 11111111, 11100000).

- Question 23
D
This expression would be equivalent to an algorithm that sets available to true whenever weekday is true and miles is at least 20. The algorithm in the flowchart requires both conditions to be true in order to set available to true.

- Question 64
B, D
Since y is initially negative, the loop condition count â‰¥ y is initially true, so the body of the loop is never executed and 0 is returned.

- Question 67
A, B
 For this code segment, count is increased to 1 when "oak" is encountered as the last element of the list. The loop then terminates and the procedure returns the intended result 1.
