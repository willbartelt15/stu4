- Fixed equation in calorie calculator
- completed team teach succesfully and am now working on hw
- Store data in backend and fixed code in forontend

## Problems I faced
- Still working on displaying code in backend. We need to work on how we can reconnect the stored data in the backend back to the frontend so our webpage can display it
- Also we Haven't been able to add presets because we aren't properly accesing our code in the backend.
