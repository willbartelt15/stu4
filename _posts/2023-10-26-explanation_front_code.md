## frontend code
- It takes the data inputted from the form and stores them as constants for the calculations
- It then uses the constants gathered to calculate the client's calorie maintenence using the Harris Benedict Equation which we found, that uses the inputs to calculate daily calorie maintenence
- Originally in frontend, but later moved to backend so that the data for the calorie maintenence is stored along with the user's information into the database
